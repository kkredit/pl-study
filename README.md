# Programming Languages Study

This repository contains notes and code generated as part of a study of programming language theory
and practice.

This is an independent study as a part of GVSU's Computer Information Systems master's program.

## Plan of Study

The goals of this study are to learn the basics of programming language theory, pick up a few new
languages, and dabble with implementing a language. To that end, I will write a simple but
non-trivial program in each language under study, go through Robert Nystrom's [_Crafting
Interpreters_](http://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html), and produce a writeup on what I've
learned.

I come from a strong background in C with familiarity with a number of languages. Languages to study
in this course will include:

* Go
* Haskell
* Rust
* Clojure

The plan outlined here is aspirational. As an independent study, my goal is to set my sights high
and execute as much as I can.

## Completion Update

Going through _Crafting Interpreters_ in addition to learning each of these languages proved to be too much. However,
see the results of the study on the wiki page, in the contents of this repo, and in particular through the following:

- [Scramble Squares Solver](https://github.com/kkredit/scramble-squares-solver) -- a puzzle solver implemented in each
    language
- [Final Impressions](https://github.com/kkredit/pl-study/wiki/Final-Impressions) -- a summary of my lessons from the
    study
