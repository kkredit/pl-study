This repository contains notes and code generated as part of a study of programming language theory
and practice.

This is an independent study as a part of GVSU's Computer Information Systems master's program.

## Plan of Study

(Subject to change)

The goals of this study are to learn the basics of programming language theory, pick up a few new
languages, and dabble with implementing a language. To that end, I will write a simple but
non-trivial program in each language under study, go through Thornsten Ball's [_Writing an
Interpreter in Go_](https://interpreterbook.com/), and produce a writeup on what I've learned.

I come from a strong background in C with familiarity with a number of languages. Languages to study
in this course will include:

- Go
- Haskell
- Rust
- Clojure
